        content="I worked with SurveyMonkey to design Build with AI, a feature that helps anyone create a high-quality survey from a simple prompt. Over six months, I shaped the AI prompt structure, feature name, terminology, and UI copy to make the experience intuitive for users of all skill levels. By analyzing competitors, introducing guided prompt patterns, refining the UX with cross-functional partners, and validating the flow through usability testing, I helped launch a feature that quickly became a top performer for new users. In its first year, it generated more than 275,000 surveys and earned strong customer feedback for making survey creation faster, easier, and more accessible.">

                <h2>Audience</h2>
                <p>Build with AI is for all survey authors, novices and experts alike. Even people on free plans can use
                    it, although they need to upgrade if they want to include premium question types in their surveys.

                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>It's hard to write a good survey. You need strong writing skills. You have to know what questions to
                    ask
                    and
                    in what order. Even if you can do all that, it takes a long time to write a survey. How could we
                    use AI to make the process easier for users of all levels?</p>

                <h3>Identifying content needs</h3>
                <p>I conducted foundational research to understand the space and the opportunities. That research included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conversation mining</li>
                    <li>Competitive analysis</li>
                    <li>Prompt engineering exploration</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    My key takeaway was this: Nearly all GPT products offered sample prompts to help users get started.
                    The product designer and I discussed these findings. We agreed that prompt writing would be our key
                    challenge.</p>

                <h3>Naming the feature</h3>
                <p>I organized a feature naming workshop with cross functional stakeholders. Our activities were as
                    follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Align on criteria for the name.</li>
                    <li>Brainstorm names according to those criteria.</li>
                    <li>Choose three of our best options.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Then I surveyed 200 people and asked them which of those three names they liked best. Names appeared
                    in random order to each respondent to prevent bias. I announced the winner to stakeholders.</p>

                <h3>Writing guidance copy</h3>
                <p>I knew from my research that many users wouldn’t be able to write prompts without guidance. So I
                    built on the idea of sample prompts from other products. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Novice users could use the prompts without making changes.</li>
                    <li>More articulate users could edit the prompts to suit their needs.</li>
                    <li>Savvy users could model their own prompts after our samples.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I worked with one of our survey methodology experts to develop and test the right prompt structure. I also explained that structure in a popout for users who wanted that level of detail.

                <p>I tested a prototype with users to find out if they understood prompts, the purpose of the samples, and the terminology.</p>
                
                <p>Participants attempted tasks like using one of the sample prompts and defining the word “prompt.” </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>5 of 5 defined the word "prompt" correctly.</li>
                    <li>3 of 5 chose "sample prompt" to describe pre-written prompts.</li>
                    <li>0 participants said they’d remove something from the page or didn’t understand its purpose.

                    even for someone with zero AI experience like myself. The AI feature exceeded my expectations,
                    allowing me to effortlessly craft a comprehensive and professional survey for our sister non-profit
                    groups. In just three attempts, I had a survey ready for board approval. Thank you, SurveyMonkey,
                    for making survey creation not only simple and intuitive but also enjoyable!"</p>
